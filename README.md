# AI Security Investigation Platform

**Live Demo Backend Link:** [https://securigation.onrender.com/](https://securigation.onrender.com/)

An AI powered security investigation platform that transforms massive security log files into evidence backed incident answers. Powered by Paritok Context Optimization for high token efficiency, reduced cost, and low latency.

---

## Features

- Paritok Context Optimization: Reduces context token payload sizes by 85% to 98% while maintaining security evidence quality.
- Evidence Pack Pipeline: Search -> Evidence Pack -> Paritok -> Groq -> Grounded Response.
- Interactive Investigation Graph: Visual node-edge entity graph (IPs, Users, Hosts, Files, C2 Servers) with click-to-filter mechanics.
- 🎯 Demo Mode (Default): Clean, distraction-free investigation workspace.
- ▶ Replay Investigation: Step-by-step trace animation showing how Paritok enabled the reasoning pipeline.
- 1-Click Pre-loaded Demo Datasets: Load incident scenarios (APT29 SSH Brute Force, Apache WebShell, Windows Lateral Movement) in 30 seconds.
- Paritok Telemetry Hero Card: Side-by-side comparison of raw context vs optimized context (Events, Tokens, Cost, Latency).
